# Sharks caught at record levels by EU-flagged longline fishing vessels in the Pacific

<b>Catches of the near-threatened Blue Shark have doubled in less than a decade, reaching almost 50,000,000 kgs in 2023, Greenpeace's analysis of recent and historical fishing data for the Western and Central Pacific region found.</b>

For: Greenpeace; Sydney Morning Herald | 2025 

In an exclusive analysis of longitudinal, multi-jurisdictional fishing data for Greenpeace and the Sydney Morning Herald, I showed how EU-flagged, Spanish-operated longliners were a key driver of the issue. Despite targeting swordfish, 70 per cent of this fleet's catch was Blue Shark in 2023. While Taiwan and Japan catch more of the species, longliners from the EU are catching this bycatch species at such a disproportionate rate that these fleet of just seven vessels had the third biggest catch of Blue Sharks across the region, even ahead of China.

Backing this desktop analysis with in-field observational data from the high seas, we also raised doubts about the data being submitted on catches of the endangered Mako Shark by this fleet. While by-catch data shows Mako Sharks being caught at low levels, we recorded three being brought up in half an hour by one Spanish vessel. This not only outnumbered the amount of swordfish that were brought up, but even its Blue Shark catch.<br><br>

### Clients, partners and results

For <b>Greenpeace Australia Pacific</b> and <b>Greenpeace International</b>, this work was part of a global campaign to develop international law through the ratification of the Global Oceans Treaty (BBNJ Agreement), and was foundational to the narrative of the South Pacific leg of this campaign, which was undertaken onboard the Rainbow Warrior in May-June 2025. 

The research was provided exclusively to <b>The Sydney Morning Herald</b> and <b>The Age</b>, where it featured prominently on the home page of the newspapers. This produced significant political momentum, with the new Environment Minister making the Global Ocean Treaty a priority. It also led to a surge in activity from Greenpeaceâ€™s members and donors. It was subdequently run in <b>The New York Post</b>, <b>The Guardian</b> and outlets in Spain.

### Methodology
This campaign focussed on the High Seas, the areas beyond the Exclusive Economic Zones that surround countries. While often regarded as some of the most lawless places on Earth, fishing of migratory species like tuna and billfish and associated bycatch like sharks is governed by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOS). The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is one of these organisations, and it makes a large amount of recent and historical data available to the public, albeit in ways that are not always neatly organised or well labelled. 

Most of the analysis was done in Python, using standard libraries such as Pandas. For visualisations, Plotly was used. Additional analysis was done in Global Fishing Watch and Marine Traffic.
 
<br><i>Finding the narrative in the data</i>

It was also intended to bring attention to the industrial fishing practices that take place on the High Seas, with longline fishing being the worst culprit. These vessels can set lines that can stretch for up to 100kms, with hundreds of hooks along them. It is a fishing practice that is an indiscriminately destructive: although longline fishing produced just 11 per cent of the total catch in the WCPFC region in 2023, making it a distant second to purse seine fishing (67 per cent), nearly but a fraction of sharks caught in the region were caught by longliners. 

<br><div align="center"><img width="687" height="385" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71ad55bc-e863-45a3-99ba-68e2d5f3eea5"  /></div><br>

Of these, one species stood out: the Blue Shark. It totalled almost 90 per cent of the region's shark catch. It is caught at such high numbers worldwide that, despite breeding polifically, it is on the cusp of becoming a threatened species.

The WCPFC's Annual Catch Estimates data for 2023 showed that the region's Blue Shark catch had almost doubled since 2015 (as measured by weight, as in standard for this data). It was also on track to become the WCPFC's third-most-caught species, moving ahead of bigeye tuna in the next few years based on current trajectories. This is despite Blue Shark being, at least officially, a non-target species (bycatch) under the WCPFC Convention. 

Three countries were responsible for the vast majority of Blue Shark catches: Taiwan, Japan and Spain. For the former fleets, this was a reflection of the scale of their fishing operations in the Pacific. Indeed, when categorising catches by both flag and species, Taiwanese-caught Blue Shark is the second most common type of catch. 

But for Spain, the data seemed to suggest that its longliners were deliberatly targetting Blue Sharks. Spain's Pacific fleet consists of just seven longliners, and only three are permanently in the WCPFC region. But these are shark-killing machines, accouning for more than one in every 10 shark catches. Although targetting swordfish, Blue Shark made up 70 per cent of their catch in 2023, a record level.

Historical data also shows that Portugese-flagged vessels caught high levels of shark when they operated in the region, further suggesting that vessels operating under the protection of the EU are aiming for bycatch rather than target species.

The Taiwanese, Japanese and Spanish fleets were also the only ones for whom Blue Shark totalled more than 20 per cent of their total haul. But only Spain has a Blue Shark catch that goes beyond 50 per cent, which it does by some margin. So much so that, for longliners in the WCPFC region, Spain caught more of this single bycatch species than Australia and New Zealand's combined haul of target species (tuna and billfish).

<i>Exploring the Spanish fleet</i>

Signatories to the WCPFC convention typically provide annual reports to the Commission, in which they provide more details on their catches. For the EU, this included details of the zones (as defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) in which species were caught. 

<img width="1318" height="760" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4baea12-1200-4d18-a9ca-56c15ba80cb7" />
<br><br>
The EU's report also included details of the individual longerliners operating in the region, and their hauls by spicies and zones. This helped us to get a clearer picture of their activity. For example, it showed that disproportionate bycatch was not restricted to rogue vessels, but was consistent across the EU fleet. It also showed the size of the hauls, which are roughly consistent with their storage capacity, as can be seen in shipping registration records. Furthermore, it showed that, for one vessel, almost 90 per cent of its catch was shark species, including the fleet's second highest proportion of catches of the endangered Short-Finned Mako.<br><br>

This was particulary significant because our analysis of historical data from Marine Traffic showed that vessel was one of the EU fleet's most active in the region where our campaign was focussed. 

We could also see from this tracking data that the vessel operated in particular patch of the Tasman Sea, just beyond the borders of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. Indeed, analysis of fishing data for 2024 from Global Fishing Watch showed that there was an unoffical demarcation of the High Seas area between Australia and New Zealand, with certain areas used almost exclusively by fleets operating under particualr flags. The Japanese, coloured blue in the below map, tended to operate in the far north and south of that region. Taiwan (green) tended to stay in the middle. Spain is shown in pink. China had no presence in the region in 2024, but was very active in the South Fiji Basin, and in other years has operated in the High Seas between Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and New Caledonia.

We could also use data from Marine Traffic, Global Fishing Watch and similar services to get a better understanding of the moverments of these vessels. This allowed us to estimate the length of the longlines it was using, and the periods of the day a vessel was setting and collecting its lines. As the examples below, of two Taiwanese longliners, shows how histograms, using 8-hour bins, highlighted the trends in the data.<br>

The data on Marine Traffic could also be used to understand - or at least to guesstimate - the length of the gear that individual ships were using, and their patterns of setting and collecting.<br><br>

<i>Bycatch data</i>
<br>

The WCPFC almost makes bycatch data available. This data is severely disadvantaged by the relaitve scarcity of data it contains: the data is collected by independent observers that occassionally travel on these vessels. Therefore, the numbers in this data are a fraction of those found in the Annual Catch Estimates data. However, the data is more granular when it comes to location of catches (based on 5x5 coordiante grids), and it also includes non-fish species (such as birds and turtles). This allowed us to see that the Tasman Sea is a hotspot for sea birds being caught by longliners. (Sea birds are caught on the hooks when they dive into water to catch a fish, and instead take the bait.) 

<br><div align="center"><img width="768" height="652" alt="image(3)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd17f682-40d5-4b09-9016-fb7bb40e0e8c" /></div><br>

This bycatch data was an important comparison point to data we collected in the field when observing one of the Spanish vessels. We observed this on Rainbow Warrior, with spotters watching the line and haul, and calling out each time a hook or buoy was brought up,  what was or was not on it, and if the catch was released or brought on board. (No sharks were released.) Our data, although just a small window into activity in the fishery, raises serious questions about the the accuracy of the official observer data, given how vastly different they are. It was also notable that the number of sharks brought in vastly outnumbered the very few target species like swordfish brought in. This in-field research helped us to get a more defined picture of the industrial fishing practices happening on the High Seas.
