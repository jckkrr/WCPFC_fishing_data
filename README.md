# Sharks caught at record levels by EU-flagged longline fishing vessels in the Pacific

<b>Catches of the near-threatened Blue Shark have doubled in less than a decade, reaching almost 50,000,000 kgs in 2023, the latest data from the Western and Central Pacific region shows.</b>

For: Greenpeace; Sydney Morning Herald | 2025

In an exclusive analysis of longitudinal, multi-jurisdictional fishing data for Greenpeace and the Sydney Morning Herald, I showed how EU-flagged, Spanish-operated longliners were a key driver of the issue. Despite targeting swordfish, 70 per cent of this fleet's catch was Blue Shark in 2023. While Taiwan and Japan catch more of the species, longliners from the EU are catching this bycatch species at such a disproportionate rate that these fleet of just seven vessels had the third biggest catch of Blue Sharks across the region, even ahead of China.

Backing this desktop analysis with in-field observational data from the high seas, we also raised doubts about the data being submitted on catches of the endangered Mako Shark by this fleet. While by-catch data shows Mako Sharks being caught at low levels, we recorded three being brought up in half an hour by one Spanish vessel. This not only outnumbered the amount of swordfish that were brought up, but even its Blue Shark catch.<br><br>

### Clients, partners and results

For <b>Greenpeace Australia Pacific</b> and <b>Greenpeace International</b>, this work was part of a global campaign to develop international law through the ratification of the Global Oceans Treaty (BBNJ Agreement), and was foundational to the narrative of the South Pacific leg of this campaign, which was undertaken onboard the Rainbow Warrior in May-June 2025. 

The research was provided exclusively to <b>The Sydney Morning Herald</b> and <b>The Age</b>, where it featured prominently on the home page of the newspapers. This produced significant political momentum, with the new Environment Minister making the Global Ocean Treaty a priority. It also led to a surge in activity from Greenpeaceâ€™s members and donors. It was subdequently run in <b>The New York Post</b>, <b>The Guardian</b> and outlets in Spain.


### Methodology
This campaign focussed on the High Seas, the areas beyond the Exclusive Economic Zones that surround countries. While often regarded as some of the most lawless places on Earth, fishing of migratory species like tuna and billfish and associated bycatch like sharks is governed by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOS). The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is one of these organisations, and it makes a large amount of recent and historical data available to the public, albeit in ways that are not always neatly organised or well labelled. 

<br><i>Finding the narrative in the data</i>

It was also intended to bring attention to the industrial fishing practices that take place on the High Seas, with longline fishing being the worst culprit. These vessels can set lines that can stretch for up to 100kms, with hundreds of hooks along them. It is a fishing practice that is an indiscriminately destructive: although longline fishing produced just 11 per cent of the total catch in the WCPFC region in 2023, making it a distant second to purse seine fishing (67 per cent), nearly but a fraction of sharks caught in the region were caught by longliners.

The data for 2023 showed that the amount of Blue Shark caught in the WCPFC region had almost doubled since 2015, and it was on track to become the WCPFC's third-most-caught species. This is despite Blue Shark being a non-target species (bycatch), at least officially. Three countries were responsible for the vast majority of Blue Shark catches: Taiwan, Japan and Spain. For the former countries, this was a reflection of the scale of their fishing operations in the Pacific. Indeed, when categorising catches by both flag and species, Taiwanese-caught Blue Shark is the second most common type of catch. 

But for Spain, the data seemed to suggest that its longliners were delibertly targetting Blue Sharks, a species that, despite breeding polifically, is caught in such large numbers that is classified as being near-threatened. Spain's Pacific fleet consists of seven longliners, of which only three are permanently in the WCPFC region. Although targetting swordfish, Blue Shark made up 70 per cent of its catch in 2023, a record level. Historical data also shows that Portugese-flagged vessels caught high levels of shark when they operated in the region, further suggesting that vessels operating under the protection of the EU are aiming for bycatch rather than target species.<br><br>

The Taiwanese, Japanese and Spanish fleets were also the only ones for whom Blue Shark totalled more than 20 per cent of their total haul (measured by weight, as in standard for the WCPFC's Annual Catch Estimates data). But only Spain has a Blue Shark catch that goes beyond 50 per cent, which it does by some margin. So much that it eclipsed the combined catch of all tuna species by Australian vessels in the WCPFC region.
