# Sharks caught at record levels in the Pacific
Greenpeace; Sydney Morning Herald | 2025 | Tags: oceans; biodiversity; vessel tracking; investigative data

<b>Endangered and near-threatened shark species are being caught at devastating levels by EU-flagged longline fishing vessels operating in the South Pacific.</b> 

In an exclusive analysis of longitudinal, multi-jurisdictional fishing data for Greenpeace and the Sydney Morning Herald, I showed that catches of the near-threatened Blue Shark in the Western and Central Pacific region have hit record levels, doubling in less than a decade to hit almost 50,000,000 kgs. 

A small fleet of EU-flagged vessels was a key driver of the issue. Despite targeting Swordfish, 70 per cent of their catch was Blue Shark, the latest figures showed. While Taiwan and Japan catch more of the species, none come close to catching them at such a disproportionate rate. This meant these Spanish-operated longliners - despite being a fleet of just seven - had the third biggest catch of Blue Sharks across the region, ahead of China.


Backing this desktop analysis with in-field observational data from the high seas, we also raised doubts about the data being submitted on catches of the endangered Mako Shark by EU-flagged vessels. While by-catch data shows Mako Sharks being caught at low levels, we recorded three being brought up in half an hour by one Spanish vessel.

Making sense of the data

Although longline fishing (11%) is a distant second to purse seine fishing (67%) when it comes to total catches, nearly all sharks that are caught are caught by longliners.

Spain, with a core fleet of just three permanent and four additional vessels operating in the region, was the third biggest catcher of blue sharks. Altough targetting swordfish, blue shark made up 70 per cent of its catch in 2023, a record level. Historical data also shows that Portugese-flagged vessels caught high levels of shark when they operated in the region, further suggesting that vessels operating under the protection of the EU are targetting bycatch rather than target species.

<b><i>Clients, partners and results</i></b>

For Greenpeace Australia Pacific and Greenpeace International, this work was part of a global campaign to develop international law through the ratification of the Global Oceans Treaty (BBNJ Agreement), and was foundational to the narrative of the South Pacific leg of this campaign, which was undertaken onboard the Rainbow Warrior in May-June 2025. 

The research was provided exclusively to The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, where it featured prominently on the home page of the newspapers. This produced significant political momentum, with the new Environment Minister making the Global Ocean Treaty a priority. It also led to a surge in activity from Greenpeaceâ€™s members and donors. It was subdequently run in Tne New York Post, The Guardian and outlets in Spain.
